# Automated-Network-Request-Management-in-ServiceNow
This project automates network-related service requests using ServiceNow. It allows users to raise requests through a service catalog with auto-filled details, approval workflows, automated task creation, and email notifications. The system reduces manual effort, improves response time, and ensures standardized ITSM network operations.
